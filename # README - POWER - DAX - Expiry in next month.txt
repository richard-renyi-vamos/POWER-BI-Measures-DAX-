Identifying Expiring Certificates in Power BI


R
create a POWER BI - POWER QUERY COLUMN for the following: [EXPIRING CERTIFICATES IN THE NEXT MONTH?] It should check if after the completion data 18 months passed (DATE OF COMPLETION column). 

If it will be the next month, the result should be "EXPIRING", otherwise "n/a"

Edit
Here's a Power BI Power Query column formula that checks if a certificate is expiring in the next month based on the completion date plus 18 months:


Copy
= if Date.IsInNextNDays(
    Date.AddMonths([DATE OF COMPLETION], 18),
    30
  ) then "EXPIRING" else "n/a"
This formula does the following:

It takes the [DATE OF COMPLETION] column and adds 18 months to it using Date.AddMonths([DATE OF COMPLETION], 18).
It then uses the Date.IsInNextNDays() function to check if the resulting date falls within the next 30 days (approximately one month).
If the condition is true, it returns "EXPIRING". Otherwise, it returns "n/a".
To use this formula:

In Power Query Editor, go to the table containing your data.
Click on "Add Column" in the top ribbon.
Choose "Custom Column".
Name the new column "EXPIRING CERTIFICATES IN THE NEXT MONTH?".
Paste the formula into the Custom Column Formula box.
Click OK to create the new column.
This will create a new column that shows "EXPIRING" for certificates that will expire in the next month (based on 18 months after the completion date) and "n/a" for all others.

Would you like me to explain any part of this formula in more detail?
