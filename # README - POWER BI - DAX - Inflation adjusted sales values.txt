To create a Power BI formula (DAX) that adjusts yearly sales prices based on yearly inflation values, you can follow these steps.

Data Assumptions
Sales Data Table: This table contains sales values with columns like Year and Sales.
Inflation Table: This table contains yearly inflation data with columns like Year and InflationRate.
Goal
Adjust the sales prices from past years to the current year's value using the inflation rates.

Steps
Create the Relationship:

Ensure that your Sales Data table and Inflation Table are linked by the Year column.
Create a DAX Measure:

The measure will calculate the adjusted sales for the most recent year.
Here's how you can do it:

dax
Copy code
Adjusted Sales = 
VAR CurrentYear = MAX('Sales Data'[Year])
VAR InflationRateCurrentYear = 
    CALCULATE(
        MAX('Inflation Table'[InflationRate]),
        'Inflation Table'[Year] = CurrentYear
    )
VAR InflationRateBaseYear = 
    CALCULATE(
        MAX('Inflation Table'[InflationRate]),
        'Inflation Table'[Year] = MAX('Sales Data'[Year])
    )
VAR AdjustedSalesValue = 
    SUMX(
        'Sales Data',
        'Sales Data'[Sales] * InflationRateCurrentYear / InflationRateBaseYear
    )
RETURN
    AdjustedSalesValue
Explanation
CurrentYear: Captures the most recent year from your Sales Data.
InflationRateCurrentYear: Grabs the inflation rate for the most recent year.
InflationRateBaseYear: Grabs the inflation rate for the specific year you're adjusting from.
AdjustedSalesValue: The core calculation, which adjusts past sales based on the inflation rate relative to the current year.
Implementation in Power BI:
Create a new measure in Power BI with the above DAX code.
Use this measure in your visuals to show sales data adjusted for inflation, with the most recent year as the baseline.
This will effectively allow you to compare sales from different years on the same price level, adjusted for inflation.
